ContentEditor
=============

The edit_me plugin makes the views of your rails app editable.  It requires
your app to be a git repository, as it uses git to track changes.

Installing
==========

You'll need the git gem

Then:

script/plugin install <git repo>

Next, add map.edit_me to the end of routes.rb

Usage
=====

In your app, hit the url /edit_me/edit_mode?editing=true.  This puts you in
edit mode.  Now when you hit your pages you will see little pencil icons in your
views.  Click one.  It should be self-explanatory from here.

Future
======

Lots to do:
Add wysmeditor
Configure which files are editable
Cosmetics, would welcome some help
File tree browser?
