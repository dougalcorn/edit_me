EditMe
=============

The edit_me plugin makes the views of your rails app editable.  It requires
your app to be a git repository, as it uses git to track changes.

Installing
==========

1. You'll need the git gem.  Add it to your rails app like so:

config.gem "schacon-git", :lib => "git", :source => "http://gems.github.com"

2. script/plugin install <git repo>

3. add map.edit_me to the end of routes.rb

4. rake edit_me:install will copy javascript and css files into you're public
directory so edit_me will be pretty and wymeditor will work

Usage
=====

Firstly, you're app has to be a git repo with an initial commit.  Doing

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

will take care of this for you.

Now fire up you're app.  To enter edit me hit the url /edit_me/edit_mode?editing=true.
This puts you in edit mode.  Now when you hit your pages you will see little
pencil icons in your views.  Click one.  You will see 2 tabs, Edit and Hitory.
Wymeditor is the editor used here.

Configuration
=============

You can change which files are editable by setting/adding to
 EditMe::Editable.includes and EditMe::Editable.excludes.  These are arrays of
regexes.

Future
======

Multiple types of editors
